PisayRPG
========

A short text-based RPG I did in high school, written in Python.
It's kinda silly, so don't expect elegantly-written code. Just run it in IDLE or whatever, it's a .py file.
Rules are self-explanatory, everything's based on our local high school culture, so there's probably stuff you won't get.
